Goodness of Fit
================

The Goodness of Fit (GoF) test helps you analyze dataset quality and class
separability before investing time in model training.

Overview
--------

GoF testing answers:

* Are my classes separable in feature space?
* Is my feature extraction appropriate?
* Will a neural network be able to learn the patterns?
* Which classes might be confused?

Running GoF tests before training saves time by identifying data or
feature extraction problems early.

     feature_extraction_name: 'Generic_1024Input_FFTBIN_64Feature_8Frame'
     gof_test: True
     frame_size: 256

   training:
     enable: True  # Can set to False for GoF-only analysis

8-Plot Analysis
---------------

GoF generates 8 different visualizations by combining three processing stages:
**2 Transforms x 2 Scalings x 2 Dimensionality Reductions = 8 plots**.

**Transforms**

* **FFT + Abs + Log**: Converts the time-series data from the time domain into the
  frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform. Only the positive half of the
  symmetric FFT output is retained. The absolute value is taken, followed by a log
  transform to compress large magnitudes.
* **Wavelet Transform (WT)**: Analyzes the data in both the time and frequency
  domains simultaneously. This makes it especially effective at capturing localized
  events in time-series data, such as sudden spikes or anomalies.

**Scalings**

* **Standard Scaler (Z-score normalization)**: Standardizes the data by subtracting
  the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, producing features with mean=0
  and standard deviation=1.
* **Min-Max Scaler**: Scales each feature to the [0, 1] range. Useful when you want
  to preserve the relative distances between data points.

**Dimensionality Reduction**

* **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: A linear method that projects the data into
  fewer dimensions while preserving as much variance as possible.
* **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: A non-linear method that
  maps high-dimensional data into 2D by preserving local neighborhood relationships.
  Especially good at revealing cluster structures.

**The 8 Combinations**

.. code-block:: text

   Plot 1: FFT+Abs+Log  +  Standard Scaler  +  PCA
   Plot 2: FFT+Abs+Log  +  Standard Scaler  +  t-SNE
   Plot 3: FFT+Abs+Log  +  MinMax Scaler    +  PCA
   Plot 4: FFT+Abs+Log  +  MinMax Scaler    +  t-SNE
   Plot 5: WT           +  Standard Scaler  +  PCA
   Plot 6: WT           +  Standard Scaler  +  t-SNE
   Plot 7: WT           +  MinMax Scaler    +  PCA
   Plot 8: WT           +  MinMax Scaler    +  t-SNE

.. important::

   Not all 8 plots need to show separable clusters. Each plot represents a different
   method of analyzing the time-series data. If **any one** of the 8 plots shows
   separable clusters, it is a strong sign that the dataset is suitable for
   classification.

Common Patterns
---------------

**Good Dataset:**

.. code-block:: text

   - Tight, well-separated clusters
   - Consistent within-class variance
   - Clear boundaries between classes

**Problematic Dataset:**

.. code-block:: text

   - Overlapping clusters
   - Outliers far from clusters
   - One class scattered, others tight

**Feature Extraction Issue:**

.. code-block:: text

   - All classes overlap completely
   - No structure visible
   - Random-looking scatter

Actionable Insights
-------------------

**If classes overlap:**

1. Try different feature extraction:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      data_processing_feature_extraction:
        # Try FFT instead of raw
        feature_extraction_name: 'Generic_1024Input_FFTBIN_64Feature_8Frame'

2. Increase feature count:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      data_processing_feature_extraction:
        feature_extraction_name: 'Generic_512Input_RAW_512Feature_1Frame'

3. Review data labeling for errors

**If one class is scattered:**

1. Check for mislabeled samples
2. Consider splitting into sub-classes
3. Need more training data for that class

**If all classes overlap:**

1. Feature extraction may be inappropriate
2. Data might not contain discriminative information
3. Consider domain expertise for better features

Frame Size Sweeping
-------------------

Sometimes the default ``frame_size`` does not capture enough of the signal to produce
meaningful GoF plots. In such cases, sweeping across multiple frame sizes can reveal
the right setting.

**Arc Fault Classification Example**

The Arc Fault dataset (two classes: *Arc* and *Normal*) demonstrates this clearly.
Starting with a small frame size and progressively increasing it:

.. code-block:: text

   frame_size=256   --> Poor: clusters lack purity, no class separation
   frame_size=512   --> Still poor: significant overlap persists
   frame_size=1024  --> Improving: WT-based plots (5-8) begin showing less overlap
   frame_size=2048  --> Better: continued improvement in WT plots
   frame_size=4096  --> Good: clear, well-separated clusters visible in
                        Plot 7 (WT + MinMax Scaler + PCA)

**Why Larger Frame Sizes Help**

The Arc Fault dataset has a high sampling frequency, meaning many data points are
recorded per second. With a small frame size, each frame captures only a tiny slice
of the signal and misses the broader pattern. Increasing the frame size allows more
data points per frame, revealing the true structure of the data.

**Recommendation**: Start with a ``frame_size`` that matches the intended model input
size. If plots are inconclusive, try 2x and 4x larger frame sizes. The frame size
that produces the clearest separation in the GoF plots is a good indicator of the
minimum signal length needed for reliable classification.

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Sweep example: run GoF at multiple frame sizes
   data_processing_feature_extraction:
     gof_test: True
     frame_size: 1024   # Try 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096

Multi-Cluster Analysis
----------------------

When a single class appears as multiple separate clusters in the GoF plots, it does
not necessarily mean the data is bad. Multiple clusters per class can arise from
real variations within the data collection process.

**Motor Fault Four-Class Example: Sampling Frequency**

Running GoF on the Motor Fault Four-Class Dataset (``frame_size=256``) revealed that
each class formed roughly **10 separate clusters**. Investigation showed that the
dataset contained samples collected at 10 different sampling frequencies (10 Hz to
100 Hz). Filtering the dataset to a single frequency (40 Hz) reduced the cluster
count from 10 per class to **4 clusters** -- one per actual class. The sampling
frequency variation had introduced unwanted structure.

**Motor Fault Six-Class Example: Equipment Variation**

The Motor Fault Six-Class Dataset showed a similar multi-cluster pattern. However,
filtering to a single sampling frequency (40 Hz) still left roughly **3 clusters per
class**. A deeper look revealed that the data had been collected from **3 different
motors**. Filtering to a single motor finally produced exactly **6 clusters**,
matching the actual number of classes.

**Common Causes of Multi-Cluster Patterns**

* Different sampling frequencies in the dataset
* Different environmental conditions during data collection
* Different equipment or sensors used across collection sessions
* Varying operational states within the same nominal class

**What To Do**

1. Examine metadata (frequency, sensor ID, conditions) for systematic variation.
2. Filter or stratify the data by the suspected variable and re-run GoF.
3. If filtering resolves the multi-cluster pattern, consider whether the model should
   be trained on the full mixed dataset or on a controlled subset.

Example: Motor Fault GoF Analysis
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   common:
     task_type: 'generic_timeseries_classification'
     target_device: 'F28P55'

   dataset:
     dataset_name: 'motor_fault_classification_dsk'

   data_processing_feature_extraction:
     feature_extraction_name: 'Input256_FFTBIN_16Feature_8Frame_3InputChannel_removeDC_2D1'
     variables: 3
     gof_test: True
     frame_size: 256

   training:
     enable: False  # GoF only, skip training

**Expected Good Results:**

.. code-block:: text

   6 fault classes showing clear separation:
   - Normal: tight cluster, well separated
   - Contaminated: distinct from normal
   - Erosion: some overlap with flaking (similar faults)
   - Flaking: some overlap with erosion
   - No Lubrication: well separated
   - Localized Fault: distinct signature

GoF Without Training
--------------------

Run GoF analysis only (no model training):

.. code-block:: yaml

   data_processing_feature_extraction:
     gof_test: True

   training:
     enable: False

   testing:
     enable: False

   compilation:
     enable: False

This is useful for:

* Rapid dataset evaluation
* Feature extraction comparison
* Data quality assessment

Comparing Feature Extraction
----------------------------

Run GoF with different feature extraction to compare:

**Configuration 1:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   data_processing_feature_extraction:
     feature_extraction_name: 'Generic_1024Input_FFTBIN_64Feature_8Frame'
     gof_test: True

**Configuration 2:**

.. code-block:: yaml

   data_processing_feature_extraction:
     feature_extraction_name: 'Generic_512Input_RAW_512Feature_1Frame'
     gof_test: True

Compare the visualizations to see which gives better separability.

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Always run GoF first**: Before long training runs
2. **Compare multiple feature extractions**: Find the best approach
3. **Investigate overlapping classes**: May need more/different data
4. **Use domain knowledge**: Understand why classes separate (or don't)
5. **Document findings**: GoF results inform model expectations

Limitations
-----------

* GoF is a linear analysis; neural networks can learn non-linear boundaries
* Good GoF doesn't guarantee good model accuracy
* Poor GoF may still yield acceptable models with enough complexity
* 2D projections can hide separability in higher dimensions

Use GoF as a guide, not a definitive answer.

Next Steps
----------

* Learn about :doc:`feature_extraction` options
* See :doc:`post_training_analysis` for model evaluation
* Proceed to training if GoF looks good
