# Tiny ML TinyVerse

- This repository is a collection of all the base level scripts that are meant to be stitched together and run by the Tiny ML-Modelmaker
- Although the scripts itself can run standalone, it is not recommended to play with it unless you're a developer who understands what is going in here.
