# Tiny ML Torch Model Optimization Repository


## Tiny ML TorchModelOpt
* [Tiny ML TorchModelOpt Documentation](./torchmodelopt/) - Tools and utilities to help the development of embedded friendly DNN(Deep Neural Network) Models in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) - we call these **model optimization tools**.
* This repository helps you to quantize (with Quantization Aware Training - QAT) your model to formats that can run optimally on TI's MCUs
* Examples for using this repository is present at [examples](./torchmodelopt/examples/)
