# Tiny ML ModelMaker

Tiny ML Modelmaker is an end-to-end model development tool that contains dataset handling, model training and compilation. Currently, it doesn't have an integrated feature to annotate data, but can accept annotated Dataset from a tool such as [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)

This repository stitches individual core scripts and utilities present in Tiny ML Tinyverse to make a simple and consistent interface for model development. This does not support all the models that can be trained and compiled using our tools, but only a subset. This is a commandline tool and requires a Linux/Windows PC.

The following are the key functionality supported by this tool:
- Dataset handling: This dataset formats supported by this tool is described in a section below. This can convert dataset formats and can automatically split the given dataset into train and validation sets (if it is not already split).
- Model training: Model training repositories such as [tinyml-tinyverse](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/tinyml-tinyverse) built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) are integrated. Several models with pretrained checkpoints are incorporated for each of these repositories. 
- Model compilation: Model compilation tools [TI’s Neural Network Compiler](https://software-dl.ti.com/mctools/nnc/mcu/users_guide/) for TI's microcontrollers have been integrated.

#### Notes
* After the model compilation, the compiled models will be available in a folder inside [./data/projects](./data/projects)
* The config file can be in .yaml or in .json format
* If the dataset has already been split into train and validation set already, it is possible to provide those paths separately as a tuple in input_data_path.
